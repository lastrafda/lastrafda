I'm no longer interested in learning go. I finished reading "Yo Claudia" like 3 months ago so that's 1 out of 4, I'm currently reading "El arte de vivir bien".
I moved to projects that used angular and node due to my company needs, I prefer react but atleast I've learned more about typescript. 
Today I'll have my first english class on italki (I'll have a class every Thursday). Oh I've also learned about E2E tests using cypress/react.


I'm currently a fullstack dev working with node, react and all things aws.I don't know if I wanna be a fullstack for the rest of my life I might end focusing on one thing who knows.

This is my plan for 2021: 

- [ ] Learn about typescript and be confident using it with react. (idk about node I'll see).
- [ ] Learn about Redux and be confident using it.
- [ ] Learn about Integration tests in react.
- [ ] Learn about E2E tests in react.
- [ ] Learn about CS
- [ ] Learn about how to build a Product/Service
- [ ] ~~Learn about Golang.~~ NO LONGER INTERESTED
- [ ] Produce quality informative videos on youtube so I can learn better and improve my communication skills. 
- [ ] Improve my english.
- [ ] Learn about functional programming in Javascript.
- [ ] Be confident using docker.
- [ ] Learn about k8s.
- [ ] Give a talk at my workplace or smt.
- [ ] Get in good shape.
- [ ] try to read at least 4 books. (1/4)

My goal is to have a better life. 
  
My favorite book is The Last Question by Isaac Asimov
