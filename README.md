## updates
### 03/06/2021: 
I'm no longer interested in learning go. I finished reading "Yo Claudia" like 3 months ago so that's 1 out of 4, I'm currently reading "El arte de vivir bien".
I moved to projects that used angular and node due to my company needs, I prefer react but atleast I've learned more about typescript. 
Today I'll have my first english class on italki (I'll have a class every Thursday). Oh I've also learned about E2E tests using cypress/react.

### 09/07/2021
I'm no longer interested in all things data, I started a podcast and I'm reading elm in action. I would like to read "El sueño de un hombre ridículo de Dostoyevsky"
